# 🔮 Customer Churn Prediction System

A machine learning project built as part of the FutureInterns Machine Learning Internship to predict customer churn for a telecom company using classification models, feature engineering, and data visualization.


---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and predict whether a customer is likely to discontinue the service (churn).
A machine learning model was developed using logistic regression and random forest algorithms, and the final output includes:

• Churn prediction model

• Churn probability scores

• Feature importance analysis

• Exported dataset for Power BI dashboard

• Business recommendations

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
    - Pandas
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib
    - Scikit-learn

- **Power BI** (for dashboard)

- **VS Code** (development environment)

- **Git & GitHub** (version control)

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Preprocessing

• Removed customerID

• Converted TotalCharges from object → numeric

• Handled missing values

• Mapped churn (Yes/No → 1/0)

• One-hot encoded all categorical features


### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

• Dataset info & summary statistics

• Churn distribution

• Feature correlations & trends


### 3. Model Training

Two models were trained and evaluated:

- **Logistic Regression**
    - Accuracy: ~80%
    - ROC AUC: ~0.84

- **Random Forest**
    - Accuracy: ~79%
    - ROC AUC: ~0.82

Logistic Regression performed slightly better on this dataset.

## 📈 Feature Importance Insights (Random Forest)

• Top factors influencing churn include:

1. TotalCharges


2. Tenure


3. MonthlyCharges


4. InternetService (Fiber Optic)


5. Contract Type


6. Online Security


7. Payment Method



• These insights helped shape the business recommendations.

## 📤 Model Output for Power BI

A CSV file containing churn predictions and churn probabilities was exported:

```.md
reports/churn_predictions.csv
```

This file can be directly imported into Power BI to build a dashboard with:

• High-risk customer segments

• Actual vs predicted churn

• Churn probability distribution

## 📝 Business Recommendations

A detailed analysis with recommendations (pricing, customer retention, contract management, service enhancements) can be found in:

```.md
reports/business_recommendations.md
```
